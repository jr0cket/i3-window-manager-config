# i3-window-manager-config

My first attempt at a configuration for the 13 window manager, please use at your own risk.

# Installation

Clone this repository into a directory called `.i3` in the root of your home directory, for example:

```
git clone https://github.com/jr0cket/i3-window-manager-config.git ~/.i3
```

> I suggest you fork this project on Github first, then you can manage your own changes.  You can also submit pull request should you find ways to improve this configuration.

Thank you
